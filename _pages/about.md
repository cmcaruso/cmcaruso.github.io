👋 Hello! I’m Camillo, a biomedical engineer and Ph.D. candidate exploring how artificial intelligence improve early diagnosis and prognosis of complex diseases, with an emphasis on learning with missing information.
I earned my M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at [University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome](https://www.unicampus.it/en/), where I first blended my passion for medicine and technology. 

Outside the lab I’m a lifelong scout, happiest when planning menus, packing supplies, and making sure our summer camps run without a hitch.
